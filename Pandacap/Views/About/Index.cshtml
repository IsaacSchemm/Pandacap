    About
</h1>

<p>
    Pandacap is a personal art gallery and feed reader, built on ASP.NET Core and Azure.
</p>

<p>
    Pandacap is a single-user application. This Pandacap instance hosts:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        A public art gallery of the user's posts (split between image posts
        on one hand, and text posts - journals and status updates - on the
        other)
    </li>
    <li>
        A gallery of the posts the user has "favorited" or "liked" on various
        sites and protocols
    </li>
    <li>
        An unlisted, but public, set of ActivityPub replies and mentions
        created by the user from within Pandacap
    </li>
    <li>
        A private "inbox" of posts created or shared by users who the main
        user follows, accessible only to the main user after logging in (split
        between image posts, text posts, shares, and podcasts)
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The instance owner logs in with their Microsoft account (access is gated
    through Entra, by applying limits to the app registration they create in
    the Azure portal during the deployment process - see the README in the
    source control repository for more detail).
</p>

<h2>
    ActivityPub
</h2>

<p>
    Pandacap acts as an ActivityPub S2S server, hosting a single actor. This
    allows Mastodon and Pixelfed users to follow the Pandacap user and see
    image and text posts in their inbox.

    Journal entries will be federated using the <code>Article</code> type;
    artwork and status updates will use <code>Note</code>. Scraps are not
    federated.
