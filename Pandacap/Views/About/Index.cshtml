<h1>
    About
</h1>

<p>
    Pandacap is a personal art gallery and follower application, built on
    ASP.NET Core and Azure.
</p>

<p>
    Pandacap is a single-user application. Each Pandacap instance hosts:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        A public art gallery of the main user's posts (split between image
        posts on one hand, and text posts - journals and status updates - on
        the other)
    </li>
    <li>
        A private "inbox" of posts created or shared by users who the main
        user follows, accessible only to the main user after logging in (split
        between image posts, text posts, and shares)
    </li>
</ol>

    Connections
</h1>

<h2>
    DeviantArt
</h2>

<p>
    Public posts on Pandacap are created by manually importing them from the
    user's DeviantArt account. The user's DeviantArt follows are also a source
    of posts for the Pandacap private inbox; these are populated periodically
    (on a timer).
</p>

<p class="small text-muted">
    Polling for journals and status updates is accomplished by checking the
    "last visited" timestamp of each user in the DeviantArt user's "friends"
    list, and checking profile posts by users who have visited DeviantArt since
    the last Pandacap inbox refresh.
</p>

<p class="small text-muted">
    Pandacap does not currently allow the user to create posts that are not
    tied back to a public DeviantArt post.
</p>

<p>
    DeviantArt is also used for authentication. Only the user specified in the
    Pandacap app settings can log in.
</p>

<h2>
    ActivityPub
</h2>

<p>
    Pandacap acts as an ActivityPub S2S server, hosting a single actor. This
    allows users of Mastodon, Pixelfed, <i>et al</i> to follow the Pandacap
    user and see image and text posts in their inbox.
</p>

<p class="small text-muted">
    Journal entries will be federated using the <code>Article</code> type;
    artwork posts and status updates will use <code>Note</code>.
</p>

<p>
    It also allows the Pandacap user to follow ActivityPub actors; image posts,
    text posts, and shares from these users are added to the appropriate
    section of the Pandacap inbox.
</p>

<p class="small text-muted">
    Shares are disabled by default for followed ActivityPub actors, but can be
    enabled on an actor-by-actor basis. Shares will appear in the inbox under
    the name of the user who shared the post, not the original poster's name.
</p>

<p>
    Likes, shares, and replies from other users are shown on the Notifications
    page.
</p>

<p class="small text-muted">
    Pandacap cannot currently send replies to ActivityPub posts; you'll need to
    reply from another account instead.
</p>

<p>
    The Pandacap user can add ActivityPub posts to a public "Favorites" page,
    which is treated as a <code>Like</code> in ActivityPub.
</p>

<h2>
    Atom/RSS
</h2>

<p>
    The Pandacap user can add RSS and Atom feeds to their follow list. Pandacap
    will check each feed periodically, and new posts in these feeds will be
    added to the appropriate section of the Pandacap inbox.
</p>

<p>
    Podcast feeds (where items have an enclosure of <code>audio/mpeg</code>)
    will appear with a "download" button that downloads the .mp3 file.
</p>

<p class="small text-muted">
    Pandacap also provides a "split" button, which splits the podcast episode
    into five-minute .wma chunks collected within a .zip file. This allows you
    to burn the .wma chunks as individual tracks to a CD-R or CD-RW using
    Windows Media Player.
</p>

<h2>
    atproto
</h2>

<p>
    Pandacap implements a small atproto client. If the Pandacap user attaches
    an atproto (e.g. Bluesky) account, posts from the account's home timeline
    (e.g. posts from users they follow) will be added to the Pandacap inbox.
</p>

<p class="small text-muted">
    Reposts are included in the Pandacap inbox in the "Shares" section, under
    the name of the sharing user.
</p>

<p>
    Posts can also be crossposted to atproto whenever they are added to
    Pandacap.
</p>

<p class="small text-muted">
    If a post is modified on the Pandacap side, it will be deleted and
    recreated on the atproto side.
</p>
